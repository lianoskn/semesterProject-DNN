## Synopsis

The aim is the project is to build a classifier that predicts which visual features are robust for long-term localization. The inputs are the 64x64 image patch around the tracked features. The robustness of the features is defined by the number of times this feature was encountered during multiple passes over the same area. We use the Tensorflow library, and experiment with CNNs, RNNs and optical flow.
